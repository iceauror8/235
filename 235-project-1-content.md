## The Story So Far

 One morning, Wehat awoke, imprisoned.

Contained by those who could not possibly understand his power. Those who did not understand their folly. The zookeepers. His mortal enemy.

This containment was, ultimately, shortlived. Mortals cannot contain a god for long. After bursting free of his enclosure, Wehat found his powers sapped. Now, he must evade his captors as he flees to safety, so he can rest and regain his strength.

And then. Revenge.
