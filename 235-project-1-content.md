## Welcome to Project 1!

This project's purpose is to serve as an example of what a game proposal site should look like! While this page is completed as though it contains a full game, the place on the site where said game would appear is currently blank. To your right, you should see an image representing what the game would look like, if the game actually existed.

Somewhere off to the right would be a few pictures of a similar game (Probably Geometry Dash)

Proposal Page
=============

## High Concept
A hardcore infinite runner!
## Genre
Endless Runner (Like Temple Run)
## Platform
Web
## Aesthetics
Simple sound, simple 2d art
## Gameplay
Play as Wehat as he escapes from his prison, vaulting over and under obstacles in his path. Can you survive? There is no win condition, you go as long as you can.
### Controls
* W/SPACE : Jump
* A/D     : Move back/forward
* S       : Slide

## The Story So Far

 One morning, Wehat awoke, imprisoned.

Contained by those who could not possibly understand his power. Those who did not understand their folly. The zookeepers. His mortal enemy.

This containment was, ultimately, shortlived. Mortals cannot contain a god for long. After bursting free of his enclosure, Wehat found his powers sapped. Now, he must evade his captors as he flees to safety, so he can rest and regain his strength.

And then. Revenge.

Project Page
============

For now, this is just going to be a placeholder with a centered element where the game would appear. Otherwise, the layout will be identical to every other page

## Documentation

#### Creative Process
* Brainstorm ideas for a game
* Transcribe content that will appear on page
* Decide on a layout that will visibly represent that content well
* Design the most important page, the proposal page, first.
* Make sure the navigation and header are standard for all pages to ensure easy navigation
* Change the color pallete to something appealing and relevent to the content

#### Resources Used
* In class exercises (Primarily those regarding CSS Grid, which most of the site uses).
* [Flexbox Froggy] (https://flexboxfroggy.com/) 
* [Bootstrap Reboot](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/reboot/) (Used to set a default style for every page, making them consistant on different browsers
* Images taken from [Fill this in later when I add images] 

#### Features I'd like to make sure are noticed
* The site keeps the tab you are currently on darker than the rest so it is easy to tell at a glance what page you are on
